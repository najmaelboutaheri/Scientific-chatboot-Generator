# RAG-Based Scientific Chatbot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Scientific Chatbot that provides insightful and contextually relevant responses to queries based on scientific documents. The chatbot leverages a language model to retrieve and synthesize information from a pre-constructed vector database of scientific knowledge.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines information from a set of relevant documents to answer questions.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Follow ongoing experiments and log updates.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: User interface for interaction.
- **Backend**: Handles data retrieval and processing using RAG architecture.
- **Database**: Stores scientific documents and experiment data.
- **Deployment**: The Streamlit app is deployed on an **Amazon EC2 instance** for scalable access.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit (for the frontend)
- Transformers (for the language model)
- FAISS (for efficient similarity search)
- EC2 Gpu based instance to deploy the app and interact with the chatbot
- Install Nvidia 

## Setup within EC2 insatnce

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/rag-scientific-chatbot.git
   cd rag-scientific-chatbot
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up the environment variables if necessary (specify any required environment variables).

## Steps Taken throughtout the deployment phase:

1. Find the EC2 Instanceâ€™s Public DNS or IP Address and verify that the type is **g4dn.xlarge**

2. Connect to the EC2 Instance via SSH
   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@your-public-dns
   ```
3. Accept the Security Warning : yes
4. You may need to set Permissions for the Key Pair as follows:
   ```bash
   chmod 400 /path/to/your-key.pem
   ```
5. You need to install CUDA Toolkit to utilize GPU resources for PyTorch.
   ```bash
   nvcc --version  # Check if nvcc is installed
   sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit  # Install CUDA Toolkit
   ```

6. After cloning the Project Repository inside the EC2 instance and installing the required packages you need to run the streamlit app file ```streamlit run app.py``` and acess the  **ngrok tunells** links or you can sart the application with **EC2 instance's public IP address**
